# Introduction
protogenOS is a lightweight turn-key styled Linux distribution which is based off of [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/). All custom configuration related to the creation of the ISO is in this repository, and serves as the basis for producing an ISO under these circumstances.

# Disclaimer
Please do keep in mind that this is an experimental distribution currently under development. You should not install this unless you know what you are doing.

### TODO:
1. A custom installer!
